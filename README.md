### Hey :dizzy:

I'm exploring interactive storytelling, graphic design, creative coding, data science and analytics.

Some of my recent works:

- [Forbes Worldâ€™s Billionaires List 2022: Interactive Shiny Dataviz (R, Shiny)](https://github.com/kor-al/Forbes-Billionaires-shiny-dataviz)
- [Pokemons data visualization (d3.js, React)](https://github.com/kor-al/pokemon)
- [Scissors Gallery (art)](https://github.com/kor-al/cizars-gallery) and [Scissors 3D Story (three.js, GLSL)](https://github.com/kor-al/scissors)
- [Poring data visualization (d3.js)](https://github.com/kor-al/porings)
